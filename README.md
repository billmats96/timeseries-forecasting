# timeseries-forecasting
Foreign exchange market timeseries prediction with linear and non-linear models using Matlab

The project involves work as part of the Timeseries course of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.

Academic Year: 2018-2019

## A Brief Description 
**Linear approach (linear.m):** 

The timeseries is split in windows of 250 observations.
Detrending methods are applied to remove noisy content.
Autocorellations and the Pormanteau diagram are used to define whether the timeseries hides info or is just a white noise series.
Parameterized ARMA(p,q) models are fit on the valuable timeseries by optimizing the AIC criteria.
1-step Predictions are applied by using the optimal models and calculation of NRMSE criteria. (Training set:150 observations, Test set: the rest 100)

**Non-Linear approach (non_linear.m):**

Assuming that the timeseries is generated by a dynamic deterministic system:
The 2-D and 3-D scatter diagrams are investigated for potential patterns, for lag τ=1, τ=2 (2D) and τ=1 (3D) respectively.
The optimal embedding dimension is using the False Nearest Neighbours method.
The correlation dimension vs embedding dimension is investigated.
1-step prediction using least squares, local average and principal component regression are made and evaluated via NRMSE versus number of neighbours
